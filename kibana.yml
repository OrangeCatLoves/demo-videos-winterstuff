# Encryption Keys for Alerting and Saved Objects
# These keys are REQUIRED for creating alerts, rules, and connectors in Kibana
# Without these keys, you'll see "Additional setup required" error when trying to create rules

# To generate a random 32-character encryption key, run this PowerShell command:
# -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 32 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
# Then replace "YOUR_KEY_HERE" below with the generated key (use the same key for all three)
